          Southeastern is a university in Louisiana of almost 15,500 students, from across the country and around the world. They are devoted to making sure their students feel like they aren't just a number to the university but that they are important as an individual. It was this active marketing change that spurred the redesign of not only their homepage, but also most of their top level pages to begin being geared toward new, incoming students.

        <h3>the task</h3>
        <p>The redesign started as a homepage redesign that would be able to funnel incoming students through to admission in a clearer and more helpful path. However, it quickly became clear that in order to do that well, we would need to readdress more pages. These included our Admissions page, Campus Life, Academics, etc. Also, by removing information geared toward enrolled students from the homepage, there would need to be a new pseudo-homepage created for them, which we deemed My Den.  </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-5">
        <h3>the process</h3>
        <p>These pages were redesigned based on the results of hours of research and multiple user group studies of not only the existing site, but also studies done after designs were done to ensure that the results were working. We worked as a committee of 8 - 10 members, from faculty, marketers, students, etc. The process took almost a year and was received very well upon launch. We created a couple new pages for existing students, and embraced new technologies, such as using a video on the homepage.  </p>

            During this redesign, we tried to adapt an existing but restrictive brand to be more open and lively for the web. These changes were based on previous marketing materials that had gone to print around the same time. This included a lot of new elements that we could begin using across the site, incorporating more photography of the campus and students, and a wider range of colors to be used across the web.

            I started working on websites years ago, and haven't stopped learning new things every day since. Technology is constantly changing and evolving, especially on the web. It's one of the things I love about it. It doesn't get old. With a background in design, as well as experience working with a team at a large company, I am confident that I can work with you to create something custom tailored to fit your needs. Let's get started.
