          Flying Tiger Aviation was a flight school specializing in Agricultural certificates and endorsements, with a large variety of aircrafts used to train students to go above and beyond industry standards. Even though they were already one of the largest agricultural aviation schools in the region, they wanted to continue growing, and they knew their website was one of the biggest hurdles ahead of them.

        <h3>the task</h3>
        <p>When I first got in touch with Flying Tiger Aviation, their brand was all over the place. Their URL was not the name of their company and their website was far from responsive. First thing first, we worked together to create a stronger, unified brand for them that we could carry through to the website. This included settling on a color palette, typefaces, as well as trying to adapt a dated logo to be used in a variety of ways across web and print. </p>

        <h3>the problems</h3>
        <p>The biggest problem during this project was a lack of a dedicated marketer that could assist with gathering the necessary content and make sure that the tone of that content remained constant. I stepped in where I could, and wrote and edited much of the content. They also lacked high quality photos, so we had to get creative with how to feature their planes and campus, and mix in stock photography where possible, while still remaining authentic.</p>

          <h2>Cultivating Aviation Professionals</h2>
          <p>
            Flying Tiger already had a tagline that they knew they wanted to stand by. Their goal wasn't to churn out students as quickly as possible, but to make sure they trained safe, conscientious, and professional pilots that could move forward with their career if they wanted. In my visits to their campus, their students were very close with the instructors and the instructors in turn were very responsive to any questions or issues the students had. That was their foundation.

            I started working on websites years ago, and haven't stopped learning new things every day since. Technology is constantly changing and evolving, especially on the web. It's one of the things I love about it. It doesn't get old. With a background in design, as well as experience working with a team at a large company, I am confident that I can work with you to create something custom tailored to fit your needs. Let's get started.
