        <h1>Start With the Basics</h1>
        <h2>My Design Process</h2>
        <p>I have an eye for design, along with a passion for showing you how a website can help fulfill your visitor's needs. Throughout the design process, I will include you in every step, eliminating wasted resources and pinpointing exactly what your website needs to maximize its potential. These days, a beautiful design is not all you need in order for your business to grow. It needs content to back the aesthetics. Together, we will get to the root of what valuable content you need, and make it speak volumes.</p>
        <p>My process typically begins with research on your company and your needs, followed by many many sketches of possible designs for your site. Once I think I'm on a good path for the design, I'll work on a mockup, which is essentially a static image of what a page might look like. Nothing on a mockup is final, and I'll look to you for changes and direction of where we should go from there. Once the design is ready, the coding will begin and that's where the magic happens.</p>

          <h1>Speak My Language</h1>
          <h2>Why I Love Code</h2>
          <p>Code is a beautiful, complex, ever changing thing. There are hundreds of ways to get something done, which can be overwhelming, but it's also a great thing to know anything is possible. I'll work with the code of your site to make sure that it's optimized, accessible, responsive, and more. I can put your site in Wordpress for you if you want to edit a site yourself and aren't comfortable with code. I can add special features, like contact forms and image sliders. If you let me know what your dream is, I will do my very best to make it happen. </p>

        <h1>The More You Learn</h1>
        <h2>I'm Never Done Learning</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of things I feel passionate about. There are infinitely more things that I find interesting and I refuse to limit myself to learning about only one thing. I don't think this is a weakness, but rather just another thing that keeps me fired up to keep moving forward, and working with the web couldn't be a better place for me. Every week, there's something new, something is changing. There's always something new to learn, and with how fast we are advancing in technology, that's not going to change any time soon.</p>

        <h2>and i really like doing a lot.</h2>
        <p>
          I started working on websites years ago, and haven't stopped learning new things every day since. Technology is constantly changing and evolving, especially on the web. It's one of the things I love about it. It doesn't get old. With a background in design, as well as experience working with a team at a large company, I am confident that I can work with you to create something custom tailored to fit your needs. Let's get started.
